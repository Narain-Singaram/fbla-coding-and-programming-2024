# FBLA for realsies 

- had ideas on incorporating an ai and basically a user can send a prompt about the data they are looking for and it would provide the specific information in terms of text for it.

- make the search more advanced where the user can search for specific fields.
- also give user the ability to order the results based on lowest to highest in terms of a field

- PDF Reports: Generate printable PDF reports summarizing partner information for offline use or presentations.

- also need to work on data validation such as what to show when no results show up and error validations

- Interactive Map Integration? because we get to statically choose the 25 businesses maybe there is a way we can integrate google maps or some map software to display to the user?

- Pagination: If you have a large number of partners, implement pagination to split the list into manageable pages, improving performance and user experience.

- Accessibility Features: Implement accessibility standards to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities.

- Translation and Localization: Offer multiple language support and localization options to cater to diverse users.


- Also include the logos of the acutal companies/communities

- and improve the ui using a nuxt tempalte possibly?
