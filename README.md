# FBLA for realsies 

- had ideas on incorporating an ai and basically a user can send a prompt about the data they are looking for and it would provide the specific information in terms of text for it.

- make the search more advanced where the user can search for specific fields.
- also give user the ability to order the results based on lowest to highest in terms of a field

- also need to work on data validation such as what to show when no results show up and error validations

- Interactive Map Integration? because we get to statically choose the 25 businesses maybe there is a way we can integrate google maps or some map software to display to the user?
